# Quality Notes

## AgentOps Foundation (Quality: B+)
- Verification passed: yes, `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check.ps1`
- Agent understandable: yes, with AGENTS, progress, decisions, features, sprint contract, and architecture docs
- Test stability: schema, SDK, instrumentation, UI shell, and API coverage for trace, RAG evidence, evaluation, Mimo judge mocks, golden dataset execution, golden dataset regression, persisted regression reports, run detail, API key security, privacy redaction, ingestion correctness, timeline pagination, and golden dataset contracts
- Architecture boundaries: API, security, privacy, observability, RAG, evaluation, regression, SDK, instrumentation, viewer, and run detail contracts documented
- Code conventions: Ruff configured and passing

## Cleanup Priorities
1. Implement retention cleanup for expired traces with dry-run and execute modes.
2. Add PostgreSQL migration planning once SQLite MVP limits are reached.
3. Add key rotation and audit logging before hosted multi-user deployments.
4. Add a richer frontend only after trace viewer usage identifies specific workflow gaps.
