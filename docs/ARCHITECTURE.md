# AgentOps Architecture

## Product Boundary

AgentOps is a developer tool for inspecting, evaluating, and improving LangGraph and RAG Agent systems. It focuses on run observability, retrieval evidence, automated answer quality checks, and regression detection.

It is not a general chatbot runtime or an enterprise Agent orchestration platform.

## Initial Module Boundaries

- `agentops_api.api`: HTTP routes and request/response wiring.
- `agentops_api.observability`: Agent run traces, reasoning timeline, tool calls, token usage, latency, and errors.
- `agentops_api.rag`: Retrieval queries, chunks, citations, hit/miss signals, and grounding evidence.
- `agentops_api.evaluation`: Hallucination risk, groundedness, answer trustworthiness, and regression checks.

## Validation Boundary

Every implementation step must preserve:

- `python harness/validate.py`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m ruff check .`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check.ps1`
